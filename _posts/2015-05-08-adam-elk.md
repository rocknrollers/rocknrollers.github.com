# Elastic search, Logstash, Kibana

Thanks to Adam for a great and informative introduction into the world of the ELK stack for reporting. 

The jist of it is this: 

Elastic Search is a document oriented database. What makes it different from MongoDB or CouchDB is that it supports a wide variety of queries that make it easier to work with and it does so very quickly.

Logstash at its heart is a text manipulation tool designed to consoliate log files on a server and combine them into a common format that makes sense for your purposes. 

Kibana is a web tool for interfacing with, you guessed it, data generated from Logstash. 

Adam walked us through his demo, which was awesome.

My takeaway was that Kibana is great for getting some prett quick graphs up and running regardless of your data set and database.
