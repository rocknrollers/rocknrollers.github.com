Docker is like chef and vagrant. It helps you set up servers. But unlike chef and vagrant, It doesn't use virtual machines to do it. Less overhead means faster servers. 

* [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/) - Lots of repos with containerized versions of your favorite server software.

Keeping things compartmentalized with Docker will force you to truly decouple your software, and give you reliable deployments.
