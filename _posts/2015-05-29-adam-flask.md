Adam's been using python a lot lately so that's what we talked about. 

Python's used a lot in data sciences. Why is that exactly? A lot of it is momentum. Ruby and Python are very similar, but also very different. Ruby was designed from the ground up to be a fun experience. The community encourages you to extend basic objects like String and write your own DSL. Python, not so much, there is the "Python way" to do things. It's easy to see how that would appeal to an academic or a data scientist.

* [iPython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) is a playground for python. It lets you share code snippets and play with them. 

* [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) a microframework for creating web services. In Ruby you have Sinatra, in Javascript you have Express, but this is Flask for Python.
