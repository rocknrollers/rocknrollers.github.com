tl;dr It’s kinda like c, but newer and cooler.

I wanted to share what I’ve learned so far about Go, there are many resources that explain Go more eloquently and learnedly than I can, but if you’ve never heard about Go (or golang as it’s sometimes called) or just wanted to know more then I hope this helps point you in the right direction.

I’d like to first give you a quick overview of the language and then give you some of my impressions.

## Quick overview

Go was started at Google in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike and Ken. They wanted a language with modern features (e.g. garbage collection and concurrency), but they also wanted to leave out some modern features (e.g. inheritance, dynamic typing, overloading, generics) that they felt caused programs to become unmaintainable and needlessly complex. Its first public release was in 2009 and Google has since expanded features and the standard library. At the time or writing the current version is 1.4.2 and githut.info shows 22k active repos on Github. 

In explaining why I like Go, I find myself not sounding very sexy, and for good reason. Go is a collection of ideas about programming and software development that are mostly not new. They’re not dangerous and easy, but rather, they’re utterly safe and reliable. Indeed, if JavaScript and C++ are Porche and Lambourgini then Go is most definitely a Volvo. It should be noted that my dream family vehicle is a hybrid Volvo SUV.
In no particular order

## Idioms

An idiom is a convention followed by the users of the language, not a part of the language itself. Go has a large standard library written in “idiomatic Go” as termed by the Go community. It follows conventions that allow for common tasks in any programming language to be accomplished using the tools Go provides.

## Functions

You can write them, pass them, return them, assign them, array them, name them, don’t name them and send them through a channel to solve some really interesting concurrency requirements.

## Concurrency

This part is actually pretty sexy. Go’s manages interactions between concurrent processes based on ideas put forth in Tony Hoare’s 2004 Communicating Sequential Processes. The book outlines methods for modeling interactions between processes, grouping them together as interacting systems and uses lots of math. I choose to regard these proofs as self evident and continue learning the parts that make sense.

## Style

Go’s style is mostly unambiguous. For the majority of cases there is only one correct way to align variables, to indent lines, insert new lines and to place spaces before or after parens. Go comes with a tool called gofmt (go format) which ensures that go code the world over looks the same, letting programmers concentrate on the meat of the program.

## Errors

In a lot of languages, less critical errors are called exceptions and give rise to constructs like try, catch, finally or begin, rescue, ensure. Go saves on this overhead and instead, errors are handled explicitly, often in the following idiomatic way.

{% highlight go %}
// The function DoSomething always returns two values, the intended output and an error.
output, err := packageName.DoSomething(“input”)
if err != nil {
  log.Fatal(“Angels and ministers of grace defend us.”)
} 
{% endhighlight %}

Handling errors as though we expected them to happen is a strong statement about Go philosophy. It says “stuff happens, it should be handled.”

## Testing

The standard library comes with a package that allows you to write tests for your code. They can be as simple or as complex as you like, they only require that you import the package, and follow some naming conventions when it comes to the testing functions and file names containing the code. Using the command `go test` will look for those files and execute them. 

## Developing

When you install Go, you also get a code compiler you get a few tools in with the mix. `gofmt` beautifys your code, `go get` grabs packages from the web, `go test` runs your unit tests, and go fix will actually take code that you wrote for an older API and convert it into code that works with the newer API.

## Packages

Go doesn’t have any dynamic linking, so everything must be compiled into one executable. This means a directory structure that is well defined that allows for well organized packages and libraries. As a result go can download and install packages and dependencies with a simple command `go get github.com/lib/pg`

## Should your team use Go?

I’m a pragmatist. I believe you should use whatever gets the job done, as long as you define your job well and define what your job isn’t you should be good.
If you need a web service that runs fast and you like explicit, non-magical code then you should definitely use Go.
