We want to make the world a better place. We think technology solves a lot of problems that stand in the way of a better world. But everyday folks don't change the world, rockstars do. What is a rockstar? They're easily identifiable as someone whose thinking and execution is on a completely different level than your own. Are we rockstars? By no stretch. But we recognize them. And so we rock out.

Equal parts circus, ted talk, and brain storming session hosted by information age grease monkeys.
 
We're here because

* we like technology
* we like new technology
* we've used new technology to make something
* we like community
* sharing is caring
